# BloonsTD-AssmeblyX86-project
Bloons Tower Defense -> assemblyX86 - project

BloonsTD programmed by me in AssemblyX86.

I was programming this project for a school project.

You can run this program by running the .exe file in DOSBox x86.

*make sure all the files are extracted and in the same folder with the .exe file*

HAVE FUN!
